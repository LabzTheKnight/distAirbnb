# Login Screen Hydration Fix

## Problem Identified
The React Error #418 (Hydration Mismatch) was specifically occurring on the **login screen** (and register screen), not on the main tabs screens.

## Root Cause
The `KeyboardAvoidingView` component with `Platform.OS` conditional logic was causing hydration mismatches:

```tsx
<KeyboardAvoidingView 
    behavior={Platform.OS === 'ios' ? 'padding' : 'height'}
    className="flex-1"
>
```

### Why This Caused Issues:
1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: During SSR, `Platform.OS` might not be set correctly or consistently
2. **Client-Side Hydration**: On the client (web browser), `Platform.OS` would be 'web', creating different behavior attribute
3. **Result**: Server rendered one structure, client expected another → **Hydration Mismatch**

## Solution Applied

### 1. Login Screen (`app/(auth)/login.tsx`)
- **Removed** `KeyboardAvoidingView` wrapper
- **Removed** `Platform` import (no longer needed)
- Simplified to just use `ScrollView` directly
- For web, `KeyboardAvoidingView` is not necessary anyway

**Before:**
```tsx
import { View, Text, TextInput, TouchableOpacity, ScrollView, KeyboardAvoidingView, Platform, Alert, ActivityIndicator } from 'react-native';

return (
    <KeyboardAvoidingView 
        behavior={Platform.OS === 'ios' ? 'padding' : 'height'}
        className="flex-1"
    >
        <ScrollView>
            {/* content */}
        </ScrollView>
    </KeyboardAvoidingView>
);
```

**After:**
```tsx
import { View, Text, TextInput, TouchableOpacity, ScrollView, Alert, ActivityIndicator } from 'react-native';

return (
    <ScrollView className="flex-1 bg-gray-50" showsVerticalScrollIndicator={false}>
        {/* content */}
    </ScrollView>
);
```

### 2. Register Screen (`app/(auth)/register.tsx`)
- Applied the same fix as login screen
- Removed `KeyboardAvoidingView` and `Platform` dependencies

### 3. Context Hydration Guards (Already Applied)
- **AuthContext**: Added hydration guards to prevent SSR issues
- **ListingContext**: Added hydration guards to prevent SSR issues
- **tokenStorage**: Added browser checks for AsyncStorage access

### 4. Other Fixes
- **Platform.select()**: Changed to ternary operators in `index.tsx`
- **HelloWave**: Simplified component (removed animations)
- **docker-compose.yml**: Removed volume mount that was overwriting builds

## Why KeyboardAvoidingView Was The Issue

1. **Platform-Specific Behavior**: The `behavior` prop changes based on `Platform.OS`
2. **SSR Inconsistency**: Server doesn't know the platform during initial render
3. **Hydration Error**: React detects the mismatch when hydrating on client
4. **Web Doesn't Need It**: For web builds, keyboard avoiding is handled by the browser

## Testing

After rebuilding and restarting:
```bash
cd /home/study/coding/distAirbnb
docker-compose build --no-cache frontend
docker-compose up -d frontend
```

Navigate to http://localhost:8080 and go to the login page. The React Error #418 should now be **completely resolved**.

## Prevention

For future SSR-compatible code:
1. ✅ Avoid `Platform.OS` conditionals in render logic
2. ✅ Use hydration guards for client-only logic
3. ✅ Keep component structure consistent between server and client
4. ✅ Test in production build mode to catch hydration issues early
5. ✅ For web-specific builds, consider removing mobile-specific components like `KeyboardAvoidingView`
