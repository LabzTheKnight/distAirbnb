# 🚀 Your Project is Ready for VPS Deployment!

## What's New?

Your distributed Airbnb application is now **fully containerized** with Docker! The frontend (Expo/React Native web app) is now included in the Docker setup alongside your backend services.

## 📦 Files Added

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Dist_Airbnb/Dockerfile` | Builds frontend as static web app with Nginx |
| `Dist_Airbnb/nginx.conf` | Nginx web server configuration |
| `Dist_Airbnb/.dockerignore` | Excludes unnecessary files from Docker builds |
| `docker-compose.prod.yml` | Production Docker configuration |
| `deploy.sh` | **Automated deployment script** ⭐ |
| `health-check.sh` | Service health verification script |
| `VPS_DEPLOYMENT.md` | Complete deployment guide |
| `QUICK_DEPLOY.md` | Quick reference guide |
| `DOCKER_SETUP.md` | Technical documentation |
| `.env.example` | Environment variable template |

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Deploy to Your VPS (3 Steps!)

1. **Transfer to VPS**:
   ```bash
   # On your VPS
   git clone https://github.com/LabzTheKnight/distAirbnb.git
   cd distAirbnb
   ```

2. **Run Deployment Script**:
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```
   
3. **Access Your App**:
   - Open `http://YOUR_VPS_IP` in browser
   - That's it! 🎉

### Test Locally First

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Check status
./health-check.sh

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Before deploying, you can customize settings in `docker-compose.prod.yml`:

```yaml
# Replace with your VPS IP or domain
EXPO_PUBLIC_AUTH_URL=http://YOUR_VPS_IP:8001/api/auth
EXPO_PUBLIC_LISTING_URL=http://YOUR_VPS_IP:5000/api
```

## 📊 Your Application Stack

```
Port 80   → Frontend (Nginx serving React web app)
Port 8001 → Auth Service (Django REST API)
Port 5000 → Listing Service (Flask REST API)
Internal  → MongoDB (Database)
```

## 🛠️ Common Commands

```bash
# Deploy to VPS
./deploy.sh

# Check service health
./health-check.sh

# View all logs
docker-compose logs -f

# View specific service
docker-compose logs -f frontend

# Restart services
docker-compose restart

# Stop everything
docker-compose down

# Update and redeploy
git pull
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

## ✅ What Works Now

- ✅ Frontend served as optimized static web app
- ✅ All services run in isolated Docker containers
- ✅ Services auto-restart on failure
- ✅ MongoDB data persists across restarts
- ✅ Environment-based configuration
- ✅ Production-ready Nginx setup
- ✅ Easy one-command deployment
- ✅ Health monitoring included

- **Full Guide**: `VPS_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment instructions
- **Technical**: `DOCKER_SETUP.md` - Architecture and troubleshooting

## 🔐 Security Recommendations

1. **Set up firewall** on your VPS
2. **Use HTTPS** with Let's Encrypt (free SSL)
3. **Use a reverse proxy** for cleaner URLs
4. **Don't expose MongoDB** port to internet
5. **Regular backups** of MongoDB data

See `VPS_DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed security setup.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Services not starting?**
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

**Port already in use?**
```bash
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep -E '80|8001|5000'
```

**Need to rebuild?**
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

## 🎓 Next Steps

1. ✅ Test locally: `docker-compose up -d`
2. ✅ Transfer to VPS
3. ✅ Run `./deploy.sh`
4. ⬜ Set up domain name
5. ⬜ Configure SSL/HTTPS
6. ⬜ Set up monitoring
7. ⬜ Configure backups

## 💡 Tips

- The `deploy.sh` script will automatically configure everything
- Use `docker-compose.prod.yml` for manual production deployment
- The frontend is optimized and minified automatically
- All services share a Docker network for internal communication
- MongoDB data is stored in a persistent Docker volume

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Your application is now ready for production deployment. The entire stack (frontend, backend, database) runs in Docker containers, making it super easy to deploy and manage on any VPS.

Just run `./deploy.sh` on your VPS and you're live! 🚀
